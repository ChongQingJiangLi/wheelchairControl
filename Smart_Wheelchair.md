# The Embedded System Team

## Our Mission
  
  Our goal is to use latest affordable, efficient sensors to create power kits that can be mounted on electric wheelchairs to give our
  users assistive autonomy. Moreover, we aim to deliver a fully functional sensor-integrated affordable modular design that can be replicated 
  by others in a feasable manner. Our kit will allow users to have a low-level autonomous system feature to help navigate through tight spaces
  such as a narrow hallway or a narrow entrance. Moreover, with our safety feature implementations, we make sure our users stay safe and have 
  full control of their electric chair will using our system
